# EmoDetect: Analyzing Emotions from Faces.

This project, centered around face emotion analysis, is developed in Python utilizing both VS Code and Jupyter Notebook. It harnesses the power of machine learning with TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning capabilities. Key libraries including Pandas, NumPy, tqdm, and opencv-contrib-python are seamlessly integrated via pip installation to support data manipulation, numerical operations, progress tracking, and computer vision tasks respectively. The core algorithm employed is Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), optimized for effectively analyzing and predicting emotions from facial expressions.

step1 : clone the repo (in order to setup the repo locally)<br />
step2 : pip install -r requirements.txt (downloading all the requirements needed in this project)<br />
step3 : run trainmodel.ipnyb (train the model)<br />
step4 : run realtimedetection.py (using the trained model in real time using webcam)<br />
